Question for Oren, if local_connector with ordering is done for each edge, and
some edges require a certain order of movements to be collision-free, do we save
the orderings in the edge?

- Replace collision checking in environment with FCL
- Replace nearest neighbors checks in Graph with FLANN

- Start MRdRRT implementation
	- implement ImplicitGraph class
	- implement Tree class
	- Add some notion of a robot?
	- Test/visualize for two robots starting for opposite sides of cube


Notes
- We are assuming known map right now, constructed in SimpleEnvironment.InitMap
